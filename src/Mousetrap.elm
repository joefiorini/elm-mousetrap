module Mousetrap exposing (..)

{-| This library gives you a Signal that receives a string representing keys that were just pressed. For example, if you hold down Ctrl and press "o" then the Signal will receive the string "ctrl+o". This allows you to map values to keyboard shortcuts in one place, ie. a `case` statement or a set of guards.
